# Tomasulo-Lite
This project is being developed to incorporate small-scale processing capabilities for a variety of fields. This processor is a 16-bit CPU design written in VHDL. It is pipelined, and utilizes out-of-order execution and data forwarding with branch prediction to provide reduced program execution time.

See "CPU paper" for more technical details.
